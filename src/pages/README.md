## Folder Structure and File Naming
- Each folder correspond to every route paths that are available (see `App.tsx`). Except `utils` folder.
- File name with a "Page" suffix is the **main component** of its parent folder. This component is what react-router points to.
- Any other `.tsx` beside that containts extra components that are used inside said **main component** and/or any of its children.
