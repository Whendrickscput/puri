# Learning

In this document, I will provide the steps that I have taken, tips, and other insights that might be helpful to students or anyone who is curious about how I built this project.

## Fundamentals

First of all, I learned the basics of JavaScript from [javascript.info](https://javascript.info). This site is well-structured and perfect for beginners, when compared to MDN. It will guide you from the basic concepts all the way to advanced concepts of JavaScript.

For React, I recommend [Complete Intro to React, v8](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v8/) by Brian Holt. The way he teaches is by building real projects, which is a plus. And then, use [react.dev](https://react.dev) as a reference from time to time.

## Stack

Starting out, I use __Vite__, hence framework-less. But if I were to start over from the beginning, I would rather use __Next.js__ instead for the plethera of benefits that it offers.

I used __React Router__ for this project, but in Next.js it offers its own file system based routing, which I think its better.

This project's main functionality relies heavily on __tables__. I recommend TanStack Table if you ever need a library for creating tables.

Start building and I wish you good luck on your own journey! If you have any question, feel free to DM me on Twitter :)
